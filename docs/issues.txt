ISSUES:

-Full request construction if it does not come in one go;
-If GET of very big file (over 5 Mb), send returns -1 (due to non blocking file descriptors);
-Missing headers in responses, mostly from CGI responses;
-Error code sending in every possible request error;
-Check memory leaks;
-Can CGI object construction throw an exception?
