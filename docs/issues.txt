ISSUES:

-Full request construction if it does not come in one go; DONE!!!!
-If GET of very big file (over 5 Mb), send returns -1 (due to non blocking file descriptors); DONE!!!

Edge triggered - Get a ready event alert only once per event, if you do not read or write all of it
in one go, epoll_wait will NOT alert again for the same event;

Is Level-triggered more adequate? Considering recv and send can only by done through epoll calling. -> Level-triggered is applied for now, dge does not seem to support EPOLLOUT the way we want;

Receive buffer size: SO_RCVBUF
Send buffer size: SO_SNDBUF

-Missing headers in responses, mostly from CGI responses;
-Error code sending in every possible request error;
-Check memory leaks;
-Can CGI object construction throw an exception?

-SEND: What code should be sent when a file exists but is empty???


CGI -> Deal with non existant directives in config!

test nginx -> response to bad scripts!

confirmar -> error in index html -> bad request???


IMPORTANT: send() errors will call send() inside error() -> Shouldn't?
IMPORTANT: response 201 no POST!!


RFC Study:

-Sends 400 if there is line folding?
-A server that receives a request message with a transfer coding it does not understand SHOULD respond with 501 (Not Implemented).
-Transfer-Encoding types: chunked, compress, deflate, gzip.
- CANNOT have transfer-encoding and content-length together. Server should close the connection;
- A server MUST NOT send a response containing Transfer-Encoding unless the corresponding request indicates HTTP/1.1 (or later minor revisions).
